# Web Application Requirement

## Overview
You are tasked with creating a basic web application for a recipe management system. The application should allow users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes. Each recipe should have a title, ingredients list, instructions, and an optional image. (Login functionality is optional)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Framework optional, but would prefer implementation with React or Next.JS.
- Create pages for viewing all recipes, adding a new recipe, editing an existing recipe, and viewing a single recipe detail.
- Include appropriate form validation for adding and editing recipes.
- Ensure responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

### Backend
- Develop a RESTful API using a backend framework of your choice (Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, etc.).
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes (GET all recipes, GET single recipe by ID, POST new recipe, PUT update recipe by ID, DELETE recipe by ID).
- Utilize a database of your choice (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) to store recipe data.
- Implement basic error handling and validation on the backend.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for backend API endpoints to ensure their functionality.
